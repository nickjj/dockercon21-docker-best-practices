### Best Practices around Creating a Production Ready Web App with Docker and Docker Compose

*May 27th 2021* 

In this talk we'll go over practical Docker Compose examples of using the
override file pattern, aliases & anchors, creating a health check and making
the most of environment variables. On the Dockerfile side of things we'll go
over running containers as a non-root user, using multi-stage builds, setting
build ARGs and an ENTRYPOINT script.
